// use camelCase when defining variable names
let myFavoritePlace = 'Fullstack';
// don't use ambiguous variable names!
let x = 68;
// use names that describe the value they contain
let currentTemp = 68;


// it's ok to use short variable names as counters, like i in a for loop
for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
